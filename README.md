This code is incomplete. Many features are not implemented and there has been no testing on it. This code was written as an exploration of ctypes. The implementation is based on a brief review of keyctl documents. 

Basically what I'm saying is, go ahead and use any of this code as the base for anything else. I don't care. If you use this in production without any further review in to what it does or how it works, you are a fucking moron. This is testing code, not production code. When it's production safe I'll package it. Until it can be installed using easy_install or pip, this is not safe to use. You have been warned. 

If you ask for support, you will be ignored, laughed at. If you submit a patch, I'll probably include it. 

On Debin this will require the package libkeyutils1.
